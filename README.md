#### Technical Skills: Python, SQL, PowerBI, Excel, Data Analysis, ML

## Education
- B.Tech. (Computers and Communication Engineering) | 2020-2024

## Internships
**AI Software Developer Intern @ Vaionex Corporation (_Jan 2024 - Present_)**
- Recently started as an intern in **AI and Data Engineering team** at a budding Google cloud partnered, AI and Blockchain startup based out of New Jersey, USA
- Working on **ComfyUI** to test and create GUI based **Stable Diffusion image generation** models
  
**Marketing Analytics Intern @ SBI Card and Payments Services Ltd. (_December 2020 - Present_)**
- Wrote a **Python** program to **automate MID-TID Campaign Cashback calculations** by taking input of defined macros through a config file to reduce manual work done by employees on Excel and SAS by **4-5 hours**
- Migration of process to **Pandas** in python instead of SAS and excel provides approximately **10%** decrease in code execution time on larger datasets

## Projects

### Customer Churn Prediction 
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.
